A few years ago I was working on a business critical logistics application connecting truck owners with available loads. The application is primarily text based displaying information with a list and drill down paradigm but I wanted to provide a more visual alternative displaying origins, destinations, routes and another information on a map. There was skepticism both about the feasibility and the value of such an approach but I received permission for an experimental version. This involved 2 elements that were new to me and the company, the integration with Bing maps and the use of Typescript as the objective was to avoid any communication with our servers after loading. Also to avoid data duplication both text and graphical pages had to use the same JSON dataset often amounting to 100â€™s of kilobytes per view.
Despite a certain lack of documentation on working with Bing maps at the time development went smoothly I figured out how to pan and zoom maps changing the scale when the user changed to selection of loads he wanted to see.  The maps could be seen full screen using the then new HTML 5 API, and this was simulated for non-compliant browsers. Following review of the results with business analysts some UI changes were made but no bugs came to light. Skepticism about the usefulness of the feature continued until the bills from Microsoft started coming in, 2 years later they informed us that that page had become the 2nd biggest user of Bing maps in terms of the number of hits on their servers. Combining the technical challenges of working in the graphical environment with the novelty of Typescript and HTML 5 and the business benefits following initial opposition makes it stand out in my mind.
Part of the application has now been made publically accessible at https://www.landstaronline.com/loadspublic but unfortunately the maps are a premium feature unavailable to the public and constitute the major benefit to registered users.
