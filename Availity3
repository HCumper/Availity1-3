When people get sick, like a lot of people are these days, they need to see a doctor. Sometimes if they are very sick, they go into a hospital. But there lots of different types of doctor for different illnesses and different people who need. So it can be hard to find the right one. Getting treatment in hospital can be very expensive so people don't normally just pay to be there like a hotel. Instead they get insurance before they are sick. There are lots of companies that sell medical insurance and the government covers many people. Which is all good but it does get complicated with sick people looking for doctors, insurance companies have a lot of rules about the treatments they allow and where. Also doctors need to know about the insurance companies and when they have treated someone they need to collect money mostly from the insurance companies and the government and then from the patients too. 
To make it all work there have to be companies in the middle. They handle all the transactions and Availity is one of the big ones. They help doctors collect money from everyone and patients to get their payments from the insurers. There are some other things too, they make lists of doctors and pharmacies and hospitals so patients know where to go. They get permission for people to be treated and they make sure everyone knows what is going on. There are millions of these transactions so we really need companies like Availity. Most of it is done on the internet these days, which has speeded things up a lot.
